            <ol>
                
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. 
                </p>


                <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. 
                    Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.   
                </p>


                <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. 
                    Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.    
                </p>

            </ol>

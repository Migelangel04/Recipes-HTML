            A grilled ham and cheese sandwich is the ultimate comfort food, and now it’s easier than ever using the air fryer. 
            Select your bread and cheese to suit your taste. Whatever cheese you use, just be sure it’s a good melting one. Moreover, you can add special add-ons 
            to make this sandwich even better like bacon, lettuce, tomatos, onions, etc.

        <h3>Directions</h3>


        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>

                Spread mayonnaise on one side of each slice of bread. 
                With mayo side down, lightly spread 4 slices of bread with Dijon mustard, evenly top each with Swiss cheese, ham slices, folded to fit, and pickle slices. 
                Place the remaining 4 bread slices on the sandwiches, mayo side up, and lightly press sandwiches to close. 
            
            </p>


            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p>
                Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C). Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray or line with a parchment liner.   
            </p>


            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>
                Place sandwiches in the air fryer basket in a single layer, leaving some space around them. 
                You may have to cook the sandwiches in batches, depending on the size of your fryer.   
            </p>


            <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
            <p>
                Cook until sandwiches begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, and cook until cheese has melted and sandwiches are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. 
                Slice sandwiches in half and serve warm.

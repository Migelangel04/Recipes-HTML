# Recipes-HTML
Recipes using the basics of HTML. These recipes where taken off the internet and applied all that I gathered from the Odin Project thus far to create 
this HTML based project. I used VSCode, Linux Terminal Commands, Git and Github, and outside resources for the recipes to make this project.
